    <h2> The story of how this blog came to life</h2>
    <p>
        During this Corona crisis, a lot of us have extra time on their hands, it's becoming harder to stay in contact with friends and things are becoming kind of dull around the house.
        So I decided to learn some new skills, widen my horizon and do some personal growth as far as it's possible been stuck at home.
        While I was thinking about that, I had the idea to just write everything I learned down in a blog.
        On one hand, it's an opportunity to build a community, and I am telling you, on the day I am writing this, I literally haven't talked to nor texted anybody but my parents for the last 5 days... It's getting sad.
        On the other hand have I always struggled to start something new, no matter how much I wanted to do it.
        Whether it was signing in for dance class, learn a new language, or whatever.
        The organization and decision making behind it made me kind of uncomfortable &mdash; like calling the doctor &mdash; especially when I had to do it alone.
        So I put it off and when I finally got myself to do it, the learning process was often inefficient, slow, and unsatisfying.
        So for all my friends out there, who have the same problem, fear not.
        Now you can find inspiration and take comfort in my struggles, while you read my posts.
        It's going to take a while until I have some topics to choose from, but if you want to learn any of the things, I write about, everything you need to know you will find here.
        If you read the welcome section, you know the plan is to have a new Mission each month.
        I'm pretty sure depending on the complexity of the topping, there will be Missions, which need more than a month, but also some, which need less.
        There is also the possibility, that this whole concept goes down the drain if I find a topic with which I'll fall in love.
        And from that point on you will hear about nothing else in my posts for the rest of this blogs existence... but for now we stick with the plan!
        I have a few things in mind, that I always wanted to learn, but at some point, I'm going to run out of ideas and that's where you come in.
        I need you guys, to give me new challenges, maybe something you always wanted to learn? We can learn it together!
        Would be my pleasure. And if you don't get inspired, or learn anything from my posts, I hope it is at least entertaining to read!
