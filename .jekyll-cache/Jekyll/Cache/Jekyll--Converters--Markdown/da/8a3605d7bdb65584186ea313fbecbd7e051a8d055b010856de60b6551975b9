I"8<p>My grandmother was a designer and modeled her own pieces. Most pictures I‚Äôve seen of her, she is in pretty dresses, styled and posing. I bet if she had been alive when I was a child, I would be making my own closes for years now. Sadly I‚Äôve never met her, because she died before I was born. My mother still has some cloth my grandma made. One of her blouses, I wore to my graduation. It‚Äôs louse, cropped and made from a very light black fabric. It also has a bow on the bottom and the back is to be closed with row of buttons. I‚Äôve been wearing the blouse on several occasions now and I find it simply elegant and pretty. I only let my mom wash it though, because I am afraid to destroy it‚Ä¶ well, now she did. Last time it went in the laundry my mom put it in the drying machine, could also be my fault, because I didn‚Äôt tell her it was in the laundry. Anyways, now it‚Äôs all wrinkled and I don‚Äôt know if we will be able to safe it‚Ä¶
As a child I was really crafty, my mom loves to tinker and we had a pretty big room in the basement dedicated for it. It was filled with colorful papers, canvases, paints, pearls, yarns and all the stuff you can wish for. Still, I never really learned to sew, I think there was a point when my mother wanted to teach me, but I quit after the first two lessons. My mom knows how to sew, but she rather quilts, making kind of blankets, called quilts. They are made of colorful patches of fabric, sewed together to geometrical pictures. I think her fashionista gene is not as much evolved as my grandmas or mine. She has a lot pretty shows though and she knits cloth. But that‚Äôs not really my style, at all. The bottom line is, my mom can sew and will help me to learn all the basics.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-should-learn-sewing-and-why-you-sould-learn-it-as-well">Why I should learn sewing, and why you sould learn it as well!</h2>
<p>I collected some reasons for myself, why I would like to lean sewing and why I think it‚Äôs a useful skill to have.</p>
<h4 id="1-safe-money-by-doing-your-own-repairs-and-adjustments">1.	Safe money, by doing your own repairs and adjustments</h4>
<p>I think everybody has those cloth, where some seams start to fall apart, or cloth that got ripped. In the past, when something like that happened I had to store those cloths somewhere in my closet, until visited my parents, so my mom could fix them. If You don‚Äôt have a mom who can sew, you even have to bring them to a professional to be repaid for expensive cloths and throw the cheaper ones away. 
For my senior prom, in Germany it‚Äôs called the ‚ÄúAbiball‚Äù, I had a beautiful two piece dress from Sherry Hill, but it was to long. Instead of bringing it to the tailor, my mom made the adjustments and we didn‚Äôt have to spend the extra money. I do admit, if you make repairs and adjustments yourself, it might not always look absolutely perfect, but most people wouldn‚Äôt even know the difference and practice makes the expert. You can even start buying all the pretty cloths, that would look stunning on you if they would fit better. If you can sew, you can just make those adjustments at home.</p>
<h4 id="2-making-your-own-cloths">2.	Making your own cloths</h4>
<p>Every once in a while I see cloths on Instagram or on people, that I just have to have, but I cant find them anywhere in the quality I want, for an affordable price. Often they are pretty simple pieces, you could easily make yourself. With some time and practice you can even make more advances pieces like fancy dresses and blazers. When you make your own cloths, you can control <em>MATERIAL</em>, <em>QUALITY</em>, <em>STYLE</em>, <em>SUSTAINABILITY</em> and you even know where it‚Äôs from and in what circumstances it was produced. From a persons cloths you can learn a lot about them. Cloths are used to express yourself and even though a lot of people do that perfectly good with purchased cloths, with self-made cloths, you can express yourself even better.</p>
<h4 id="3-nourish-your-creativity-and-confidence">3.	Nourish your Creativity and Confidence</h4>

<p>Having a crafting hobby, challenges your creative side. Completing a project like making a new dress gives you a feeling of confidence. Building something from zerso so 100%, that‚Äôs completely modeled from your own imagination, can really be satisfying. Additionally to enjoying that achievement for yourself, you can even go outside and show off what you just created. I imagine, wearing the things that make you most comfortable, will reflect in the your confidence and the perception of how other people view you.
For me there is an additional motivation to learn sewing. Next year I want to start a Master in Textile engineering. Even though the master is focused on the technical aspect of the Materials itself, I think its an advantage, to know the most common fabrics, their basic structure and how to work them.
So my goal for this month is to understand important background about fabrics, learn all the useful repairing skills for the future and to make a little more advances piece of clothing. I am choosing a midi skirt. I wanna make that, because I just watched four seasons of Velvet, a Spanish drama about a group of seamstresses making their way in the world of fashion in the late 1950s. Some of the characters always wear these midi skirts. They look really sexy and elegant. Maybe Velvet is also one of the reason why I am so inspired to learn sewing now.</p>

<h2 id="the-plan-for-the-next-4-weeks-looks-as-followes">The plan for the next 4 weeks looks as followes:</h2>
<p>First I going to collect all the information about different materials, sewing techniques, different machines and other stuff there is to know. At least the basics.</p>

<p>Then I will start with the basics of sewing, like making a straight line and get familiar with the sewing machine. I will learn how to do the little repairs and how to make adjustments for better fitting.</p>

<p>For my first piece of clothing I wanna make a simple crop top, for sports, which I am looking for quite a time now.</p>

<p>At the end of the months I want to make the midi skirt as a second piece and a more advances challenge.</p>

<p>Because this is going to be the first project, I still have to figure out how much it is actually possible to learn in one months. I have this plan, because I want to lean as much as possible, but we just have to see how far I come.
For the blog updates, I am also still new to that, so still have to figure out how often I will post and in what structure the posts will be. Either I will sort them after specific aspects of the projects or I will just make post about my learning process altogether with all the aspects mixed together. While I am working on the project, you can follow along real time, by following my Instagram: lelinahsblog.
With that said, I am exited to start the first project and hope some of you will follow along!</p>

<p>Love,
Lelinah</p>
