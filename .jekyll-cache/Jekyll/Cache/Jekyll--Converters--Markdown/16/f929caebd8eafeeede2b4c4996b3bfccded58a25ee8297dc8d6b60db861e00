I"Â<p>A new year is beginning and with it a new month. For me, this means I am starting a new project! Last monthâ€™s project was more active and promoted my crafting skills. This month I will challenge my mind by learning a new language. To be more exact with a month-long intensive learning session.</p>
<h5 id="italian-or-spanish">Italian or Spanish?</h5>
<p>The language will be Italian. I was long torn between Spanish and Italian because Spanish is a more widespread language and I have already been teaching it myself for quite some time since I listen to a lot of Spanish songs and always want to understand them. The problem is just that I always loved Italian. I planned to learn Spanish first and then Italian, but after I spend 2 months in Italy I am leaning more towards Italian again and somehow it feels easier to me than Spanish. So, I decided to go with my gut and chose Italian for my language learning challenge.</p>
<h5 id="the-objective-of-the-month">The objective of the month</h5>
<p>Since I am not starting from zero, this month will not be about how well you can learn a language in one month. The goal is more to test different learning techniques and see what works best for me and most importantly to actually commit to learning the language intensively for one month. Iâ€™ve been trying to learn Spanish and Italian for quite some time now, but always sporadically, which is why I didnâ€™t come very far. The back and forth between Spanish and Italian wasnâ€™t helpful as wellâ€¦</p>
<h5 id="my-language-learning-background-and-longterm-goals">My language learning background and longterm goals</h5>
<p>Any languages I learn additionally to English and German are just about understanding and speaking for me, so I donâ€™t really mind if my grammar is not perfect or I cant write beautiful texts in that language. And considering this is still a hobby and supposed to be fun I donâ€™t want to pressure myself too much.</p>

<p>While I was in Italy I took one to one online classes on Italki. My tutor thought me the most basic grammar during those lessons. I will review that this month, but will not go any further grammar wise. Applying the 80/20 rule I am going to focus on learning the most important vocabulary first. When I have achieved a good enough foundation I hope the rest will just come naturally as it did with English for me. Some experts even say thatâ€™s the most effective strategy to learning a new language, which is not actually by learning it, but by acquiring it, the same way babies acquire their first language.</p>

<p>During school the only foreign language I studied besides English was Latin. My mother always let me believe it would help me learn any roman language I want to learn in the future. Maybe this would have been true if I actually had been any good at it. I literally remember about 5 Latin words. At least the mythological stories I never managed to translate were interesting! Luckily, additionally to my German vocabulary, I have a good English vocabulary and a lot of Italian/Spanish vocabulary comes from the same stem.</p>

<p>I am still torn if I should only use free resources or if I should get a tutor once a week. I hate spending money on stuff you can also acquire yourself with a bit of effort. In this case, it is the best option though to get speaking practice. I know I could use apps like a tandem, but I am too reserved to talk to strangers in Italian and I find it quite hard to find a good tandem partner. It just didnâ€™t work for me in the past.</p>

<h5 id="the-battle-plan">The battle plan</h5>
<p>To stay committed and on track, I set some goals for this month and drew up a plan. <br /></p>

<p>We have <strong>31 days</strong>. Including <strong>5 weekends</strong>. Most sides Iâ€™ve been on say you have a pretty good foundation in Italian when you have learned the <strong>1000 most frequently used words</strong>. That means I have to learn about <strong>30 new words a day</strong>. For learning words the first time I will use mnemonic strategies, which are strategies to remember random numbers and words. Which ones of these I will test, I will list later. The forgetting curve shows we forget 50% of what we learned by the next day and 90% after 1 week. To counter that, I will review the 30 words the next day, after one week, and after one month so that they will hopefully stay in my long-term memory. That means I have to review vocabulary every day even after January when I already started my new project for February. I am counting on my brain to know them well enough by then, so it will be a matter of no more than 5 min each day. If I will take lessons again, it will be a 60 min lesson on weekends. Weekends will also be the time to look at grammar. To nourish my unconscious, I will follow lots of Italian meme pages on Instagram. I will listen to all the Italian music I can find, and try to learn the lyrics of my favorite songs. If I watch Netflix, it will be in Italian, either the vocals or the subtitles. For falling asleep I like to listen to a podcast, even though I only understand little.</p>
<h5 id="mnemonic-strategies-to-learn-new-vocabulary">Mnemonic strategies to learn new vocabulary</h5>
<p>As I was saying before, I am going to try different memory strategies to remember the vocabulary. <br /></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The first one Is the <strong>Keyword strategy</strong>. You find a word from your language that sounds similar to the new vocable in Italian. You can use that word as a key and link it to the meaning of the new word.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second one is <strong>Pegword rhymes</strong>. This strategy uses rhymes to help you remember information. Either by finding a word that rhymes with the new word, and then use it as a keyword or by finding a rhyme that already connects the vocable and the meaning itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Associations</strong> are the third strategy Connecting a word with feelings, smells and images help you remember their meaning. You can also use this technique to remember names very well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The last strategy I would like to use is <strong>dual coding</strong>, meaning you make up a code for specific information, learn that code first, and then apply it to help you remember certain facts. While I donâ€™t think it would make sense to use this technique to remember the actual meaning of a word, I think it would be helpful to remember if a word is masculine or feminine or if a verb is irregular for example.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There are a few other strategies, but they donâ€™t seem applicable to learning vocabulary. They are more useful to remember specific sequences or a specific amount of words in a list. I will see if I can implement them anyway and let you know in one of the following posts.</p>

<p>Considering I donâ€™t actually make anything this week, the progress wonâ€™t be visible in pictures. This monthâ€™s updates will be more about how well the different strategies work and what tools and tips I come up with for you along the way. Learning languages doesnâ€™t come easy to me, so I hope the progress will be recognizable in some way at the end of the month, wish me luck!</p>
