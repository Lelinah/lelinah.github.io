It’s been a week since I began the sewing project. That means it’s time for an update!

The first thing I like to do when I start to learn something new is to adjust my social media. That means following several accounts on Instagram, Facebook, or whatever your preferred platform is, that provide information about the subject you are looking into. As somebody who spends a lot of time on Instagram while procrastinating, I find it useful to still have input during that downtime. In general, I see Social Media more as a pool of information to be accessed, than an entertainment side. If you are not very active on social media because you think it's a waste of time, consider using it like I that instead.
##### Research and Equipment
I started off on the first day with some research as I announced in the previous post. When I googled “How to learn sewing” the first articles that popped up suggested to learn the terminology of sewing first to understand any further articles about the subject. So, I started to go through the list of terms. Different sides focus on different “most important” words. I collected some that I thought would be helpful for my plans. The rest of the terms can be learned with the research for every individual project. As I was telling my mother about what I was doing, she started bombarding me with all the sewing terms, **BUT IN GERMAN**! So I went back online and translated the terms from English to German and from German to English. That will make it easier for me to communicate with the people from the fabric stores and my mother while writing about it in English. I will link the pages for the terms, plus translation, at the end of the post. I also tried to get an idea of the different materials by reading about them, but I didn’t really get a good picture, so I asked my mom to go to the fabric store with me, to show me some of the materials. You can also ask the shop assistant on sight to help you. To get an overview of the most common types of fabrics, I still found a pretty good poster on this website: <https://sewing.com/fabric-types-everything-you-need-to-know/>.

Before starting the first stitches, I combed through our box of old fabrics and made out all the leftovers I could use to practice on. After I finished with that box, I moved on to the sewing bag my mum has. It stores all the sewing supplies, like needles, threads, cutting knives, and fabric scissors. 
###### The Time I Nearly Cut Off My Finger
Talking about fabric scissors, I have to tell a little anecdote of that time I nearly cut off my finger: 
> You remember the craft room I talked about in the first post? Ok, so one day I had some friends over when I was 6 or 7 and we went down to the basement to do some crafting in the craft room. I don’t exactly remember what we were trying to do, but at some point, I thought it was a good idea to try and split a wooden ball in half with the fabric scissors. Everybody who knows what fabric scissors look like knows that’s NOT a good idea! So I had these 30 cm full steel scissors in one little hand and held a wooden ball with maybe a 1 cm diameter between the scissor blades in my other little hand. Thirty seconds later, I stood in front of my mum and my friend's mum crying, with blood running down my thumb. Lucky me, my friend's mum was a nurse, so she patched me up right away!

Don’t worry, My thumb is still there! I just cut off a little piece of the tip. I guess I learned the hard way not to try to cut everything with huge scissors. 

Back to the topic. I cleaned out that sewing bag – early charismas present for my mom: check – and got on the machine. We have a 25 year old Bernina 1001 – Someone once called the brand Bernina the Mercedes among the sewing machines – that was made in Switzerland. I just call her Bernina.

##### The First Practice Session
To get familiar with her, I grabbed one of the longer fabric pieces and started sewing straight lines. I practiced the beginning and the end of the seam where you have to go back and forth, so the thread holds and I experimented with the different stitching lengths. Bernina can vary between 0 and 5. I noticed 0 is just stitching in place. After practicing the straight lines on a single layer of fabric, I moved on to stitching two fabrics together. For that, I used already cut squares my mom had leftover and sewed 8 or more together. I also added some decorative stitching around the practical stitching. 
As a finishing touch, I tried making hems on each side. The hem is created by double laying the fabric edge, to hide it. 
The first side didn’t come out too nice. I constantly lost the path of the straight line, when the obstacle of the multilayer spots (joining of two patches) came up. I also sewed the fabric the wrong way around, with the left side up. Because of that, the bobbin (lower) thread was visible on the right side. Bernina has some difficulties with a greater amount of fabric, so the bobbin part of the seam came out a little wobbly. After correcting all these mistakes, the second hem looked way better. In the next couple of days, we will oil and clean Bernina, so hopefully, there won’t be any more wabbly stuff happening. In the end, I sewed together the ends of the patchwork and created a random loopy thing. That’s it for my first practice session.

##### The First Repair
Now that I got acquainted and comfortable with Bernina, I wanted to repair a blouse that I gave to my mother for repairing weeks ago. It’s an olive green one from Zara. I looked for a fitting thread, pinned down along the lost seam, and started retracing it. On the first try, I sewed in half of the sleeve. So I opened the stitches up again and the second time the result looked pretty good. The blouse can be worn again. Success!

##### Visiting The Fabric Store
The next stop was the fabric store with my mom. We drove to a pretty big one called “Resotex – Die Welt der Stoffe (English: the world of fabrics). We went through the aisles, felt some surfaces and my mom always said something about the material. I checked the composition of a lot of fabrics and as a bonus, I found some of the polymers included, that I just learned about in one of my classes, like polyamide and polyester. Interesting sustainability fact: Polyester needs 100 years to biodegrade. That’s way too long! For the long run, I have to find sustainable materials to work with, or I’ll just do thrift flipping. I read a lot about it in the last few days, but more about that in a future post. I was looking for a nice thick winter fabric for my skirt and a specific kind of fabric for the top I want to make. For that, I am trying to go for the Skims (the brand of Kim Kardashian) bodies material and I didn’t really know how to describe it so I just wandered around until I found something that closely resembled what I was searching for. In the end, I found out it’s called “Power Stretch”. As we just went to the store for research purposes, I didn’t buy anything yet. Furthermore, I had to get a sewing pattern &ndash; at this point, I’d really love to deglish. You should see my notes: Everything perfectly fine in English and then always “Schnittmuster"... “Schnittmuster”..., but it’s good for me to learn the terms in English as well &ndash; before buying the fabric, so I know how much I need of it. On the search for the sewing pattern, my mum and I went to the next sewing shop. It had fewer fabrics, but it had sewing patterns. After looking through the catalog, we decided on a pattern for the skirt but didn’t find one for the top. We also bought some sewing machine oil for Bernina. For the shirt, I decided to make my own sewing pattern, because I just recently bought a body from Zara that has a similar cut to the one I want and I can just copy and adjust it. For that reason, I purchased some transparent paper for sewing on amazon and a chalk pen with it. If the articles are any good I will link them in the next post. 
##### Making Scrunchies
On Saturday morning I bought a sewing kit from Aldi for making masks, little purses, and scrunchies. The fabric inside seems like a very thin and cheap fabric &ndash; I don’t know what you want to do with a mask made out of that… &ndash;, but perfectly fine for practice. Back at home, I tried my hand at the scrunchies. The basic concept was easy, but the creators of the directions didn’t find it necessary to close up the loose ends at the end and proposed to just luck one end into the other. In my hands, it kept falling apart! So I went online and found a much better way to make scrunchies. I will link the YouTube video below. The rest of the day I made more scrunchies and experimented with different fabrics, sizes, and elastics. For my taste, the optimal size is an 8 inch, somewhat looser elastic with a 17x4 inch piece of fabric (1cm seam allowance included). In addition to using the fabric that I already had, I took apart one of my old dresses and used that fabric to make even more scrunchies.

With every scrunchie, I got more and more comfortable with Bernina and each one was better than the last. So, I think it’s safe to say that sewing is, like most other skills, one that needs a lot of actual practice. It is a good idea as a beginner to get that practice with a simple pattern, to get down the routine of putting in the bobbin thread, threading in the top thread, and all the other little things that are constant tasks accompanying the process of sewing.
##### Leggings become biker shorts
The last task for this week was to resew a pair of old leggings of mine into biker shorts. They're shiny leggings with R2D2 and C3PO printed on it. I bought it on amazon years ago and didn’t wear it for a while now. To find out where to cut the legs off, I put the leggings on and pinned down a good length on one leg. After taking the leggings of I laid one leg on the other and cut everything off at once with a 1 cm seam allowance. Then I flipped over that 1 cm and pinned it in place. Till now I thought this was a super easy rework, so I just sewed both legs with the normal stitch and tried it on again. First of all, the shorts became a little shorter than I intended them to be, and second of all, my legs got squished by the seam. As typical for leggings, the fabric is very stretchy and the classic stitch is not stretchy at all. What did I do? I ran to my mom for help. She proposed to use a different stitch made of 2 normal stitches and one zigzag. For it to work properly I also had to turn the zigzag module to 3 and the stitching length to 1. After trying it out on the leftover fabric and getting a good outcome, I opened up the first sewing on the shorts and repeated the whole process with the new stitch. Now the fit is way more comfortable. I am pretty happy how it came out. I think one leg is longer than the other though, but it’s not that obvious… I hope.

While I am sewing my little projects, I am also getting familiar with making Reels on Instagram, so I can make some nice quick tutorials. Hopefully, I get the hang of it soon!

As the last statement for this week, I want to encourage everybody again (this also applies to different hobbies) to just go out in the stores and ASK the experts for help! In every sewing shop, I’ve been in the past and go now, the job assistants are super helpful. They are very enthusiastic about what they are selling and they will be more than happy to help you get started. So don’t be shy and just ask!
##### What's next?
In the days to come, I will probably make more scrunchies… Guess what all my friends are gonna get for Christmas!
I will also go out again to buy the fabrics for my two pieces and get started with that shirt as soon as the transparent paper arrives. 

I don’t have anything specific planned, but I will most likely resew some clothes of mine this week, so stay tuned for that on my Instagram account (lelinahsblog) and for everything else to come.
I’ll check in with you again next week to give the next update!

Till then, love <br>
