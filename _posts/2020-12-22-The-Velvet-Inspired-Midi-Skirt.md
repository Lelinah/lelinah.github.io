Week number 3 has come to an end, and I already finished the “Masterpiece”. I kind of fell in a two-day sewing rush … I was so excited to finish this skirt! So the main thing I did this week was that. I am going to tush on some problem I ran into while sewing it and some alterations I made to the instructions from the sewing pattern I bought.
##### The Sewing Pattern
I already got this pattern one or two weeks ago. It’s a pattern from the brand Burda and runs under one of their “super EASY” patterns as number 8155. 
![](/img/sewing/Pattern.jpg)
Most of the time a sewing pattern includes two different patterns, which are very similar to each other. So does this one. I chose style A, which has a high waistband and a longer cut. When you buy the sewing pattern it comes with step by step instructions in several languages and includes a list of materials and how much of them you need to buy. 
The sewing pattern itself is designed for the sizes 34 to 46. There is a size chart on the sheet, a key of symbols, a layout to position the pieces of the pattern on the fabric, and instructions on how t add seam and hem allowance. 
##### Cutting The Fabric
Obviously, I already had to do something different with the first, most simple step. My mom always tells me to save as much material as possible! I’ve been hearing this since I held my first scissors in my hands. And now that I am 21 I still get to hear it. As this was my first sewing project in which I had to follow a more complex sewing pattern I asked her to support me a little. 
So when laying out the fabric and the patterns on top of the fabric, she immediately proposed to try and outsmart the layout on the sewing pattern, as I was making the skirt in a size 36 and the pattern was for sizes up to 46. 
We minimized the overlay of fabric and made our own layout, so everything would still fit on the piece of fabric afterward and keeping the straight grain in mind for each piece of the pattern.

I used needles to mark the 1,5 cm of seam allowance and where the 4 cm for the hem should be, I just left the rest of the fabric.
![](/img/sewing/Nahtzugabe.jpg)
In retrospect, It would have been wiser to cut it the right size at this point, because later the hem allowance for the front and back piece was not the same size and I had to cut it off when it was already sewed together. It became a little tilted and as you can see the line of the hem very slightly at the bottom, it is not optimal. 
![](/img/sewing/All_cut_pieces.jpg)
After cutting the pieces, I copied the sewing lines from the piece with the pattern on it onto the second layer of fabric with a basting stitch.

Make sure, you don’t forget to transfer all the extra markings on the pattern onto the fabric as well. Oh, while we are on the topic, those makings need to be on the pattern you made before as well, so don’t forget them on there in the first place, like me. I had to add them before getting started on the fabric because I only copied the outlines last week.


##### The Zipper Battle
One of the first steps is to sew the two back pieces together and then add the sipper. Like a good girl, I followed the instructions without doubting a thing. When I positioned the sipper, I thought it to be a little complicated and decided to watch a [tutorial on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XTCQsSLBFw). 
<br>The instructions foresee a variation where the thread will be seen around the zipper on the right side. The video I found secured the invisible zipper seamless. That’s kind of the point of a invisible zipper, isn’t it? 
<br>So I decided to go with the youtube video. The only problem was, that the back pieces weren’t supposed to be sewed together before adding the zipper. I tried to do it in anyways and just wing it at the end. 
<br>I didn’t sew it in very nicely though and you could still see a lot of the dark color from the zipper, even when it was closed. So I took it out again and tried a second time. The issue was that I was trying to keep the 20 cm of the zipper length as foreseen in the instructions. When doing so, you can only sew to a point with an open zipper and have to sew the last part with a closed zipper. If the zipper is closed though, you can’t reach as close to the zipper teeth as before, so that the last few centimeters the visible part of the zipper was wider.
<br>At this point, I thought that’s the best I could do and moved on. Later when I added the waistband I got so annoyed with the look of the zipper, I took it out **AGAIN** before the last chance to change it was gone.
<br>So this time I opened up the seam below the zipper a bit and sewed the zipper in place as far as I could with it being open. Thereby,  I could follow the instructions from the youtube video step by step, even though I lost 1 or 2 cm of the zipper.
<br>It looked so much better than before, so definitely worth it. If you intend to keep the length of the sipper you should get a longer one in advance.
<br>I think adding a perfect seamless zipper needs a bit of practice because after the third try I’m still not 100% happy.
<br>I’m sorry, I didn’t take a picture of every state the zipper was in, so here is one of the final result.

##### The Belt Loops And The Waistband
I continued as described in the instructions. Stitching the belt loops on with hand was kind of a “Friemelarbeit” – That’s a German word for doing annoying work for which you need a lot of patients -. In the end, two of them came out a little wonky and I didn’t want to do them again.

The top of the waistband is a curved line. I tried to follow that curve the best I could, but in the end, it came out a bit uneven, but not too bad.

##### The Decorative Stitching
At some point, you have to do decorative stitching at the bottom rim of the waistband, which fixates the second layer of the waistband at the same time. 
First of all, I got totally confused with the steps, because at that point the steps for the second skirt started to differ and I did the decorative stitching without the second half of the waistband first. 
After noticing my mistake I opened it up again and did it the right way. 
The first issue is, that decorative stitching has to be very close to the base stitching and if you don’t sew totally straight it will show. The smaller the space between two parallel lines, the more it will show if the second one is crooked.
![](/img/sewing/Ziehrnaht.jpg)
I practiced this on my first day of sewing when I was doing the weird loopy thing, but I won’t claim I’m an expert. 
Second thing is, for the inner part of the waistband, that little distance is the only space you have for seam allowance.
As I was too concentrated on keeping a straight line, I didn’t think about checking the seam on the other side. The consequence was, that the fabric on the inside escaped the stitching a couple of times and I had to fixate those spots by hand afterward.

##### Changing The Fit
Before closing the hem at the bottom and with it finishing the skirt, I tried it on. For me, the skirt fell too straight at the sides, so I pinned sown as much fabric as I thought suitable, to make the skirt follow the shape of my body better. I sewed it next to the old seam and opened that one up, so I could iron the overlapping fabric down without any build-up and closed the hem at the bottom.
![](/img/sewing/Seitennaht.jpg)
You can still see where the seam was before, by following the line marked with the bright biasing thread.
##### Project Skirt All Together
Those were all the specific problems I had, now some things to look out for threw out the whole process: If sewing multiple layers of fabric consider manually moving the needle, so it doesn’t break under pressure. I did this several times, especially while adding the waistband and because of carelessness I still broke two needles. 
![](/img/sewing/Nadeln_broken.jpg)
The reason those needles broke could also have been that I didn’t use the right ones. Needles have different thicknesses and depending on the thickness of the fabric you are sewing you should use a fitting needle. Our needles lie around loosely and don’t have any indicators for the thickness, so I just used random ones. 

Now that I am done, I think I could have made a 34 instead of a 36. The pattern is made for a more loose fit, but I really wanted that snatched look the skirts from Velvet gave the girls. 
That’s why I will make the skirt tighter around the waist at some point, but for now, I am very happy with the turnout. I can tell you, my parents were impressed, my friends were impressed and I was impressed by how professional this skirt looks. See what you can do? You just have to follow instructions!
<br> Here are some outfits I made with the skirt.

Another point I wanted to talk about today, was the money I spent on this skirt. I remember in my first post I was saying how sewing your own clothes is super cheap, blablabla. It is not actually that cheap. I spend around 50 euro on all the materials. I still have a lot of leftovers though and I think the quality of the skirt is a better one than if I would have bought it for 50 € from Zara. 


For the belt, I am wearing I had to add two more holes. Lucky me, my family is covered with nearly everything, including two punching pliers. As I was pushing those holes, I found out, that my great-grandpa owned a fashion house and my grandma worked there as a shop assistant. How was my whole family in the business of fashion? Isn’t it funny how you find out stuff about people you have known for your whole life, just by starting a random project at the age of 21…
##### The Second Try On The Top
So I gave the top a second try and it is better, but the problems from the first fit haven’t been fully solved.
![](/img/sewing/second_top_fit_front.jpg)
![](/img/sewing/second_top_fit_back.jpg)
The neckline was an easy fix, but the fold on the back is still there. Not as big, but still there. I also wore the top for a longer time and notices, that the fabric stretches out easily, resulting in the top to slip up a little. Do I make the top tighter now or will that just stretch out the fabric more extreme? Should I just make it longer? I am not sure…

I already told you I wanted a second layer of fabric, but now I noticed that it is a necessity, because you can't wear a bra underneath because of the back cutout. I was thinking about maybe adding some interfacing at the breast area, but I don’t know if that is comfortable to wear or would even look good. We will see. 
I have enough fabric to make one more top and I will experiment a little with the first one, so I don’t ruin the second, better top.
##### Embraiding The Scrunchies
I didn’t come too far with the embraiding. At this point, I only tried it once on one of my yellow scrunchies. I realized you can only do it where the seam is still open and the yellow ones are the only ones I didn’t close up yet. 
![](/img/sewing/Stickerrei_LEA.jpg)
It looks okay, but not really good. As the yellow fabric has these furry parts, I had some problems with the fabric sticking out between the lines of thread and I couldn't really see where I was inserting my needle as well. 
For embraiding like this I probably need one of these devices, that stretch out the fabric a bit so you can work easier and you probably have to add it before even start sewing the scrunchie.
I really wanted to make individualized scrunchies for all my besties for Christmas, but I think that ship has sailed. 
###### Update On The Smaller Side Projects
Last week I talked about a dress I wanted to make smaller around the waist. Well, I tried that, but it looks so uneven. 
![](/img/sewing/schiefe_nahten.jpg)
The dress Is made out of this super stretchy, cuff like fabric and that made it really hard to follow the line as I wanted to. In the end, I had to open the stitches up again, because it didn’t make the dress look better than before but worse. I will have to practice that if I have some extra time on my hands.
 
I also had an idea for the black dress I made into a two-piece. My mom made me a leotard out of this fabric when I was younger that looks pretty much the same as the one the dress is made out of, just without the leopard print. 
So, I thought I could make I ribbon out of it, to add to the bottom of the top. That fabric sadly is also very stretchy and kept curling in on the sides, so I didn’t manage to cut a straight line, and the fabric started to unravel much faster than all the other fabrics I worked with so far. 
In the end, the ribbon came out a bit short and I didn’t use a stretchy stitch, so it also lost part of its stretchiness. 
##### What’s Next?
Looking back on this week, I am kind of torn. I feel like I failed at almost everything I tried, but the most important part, the skirt, went well, so that makes me feel better.

Basically, we are done! Haha, I’m kidding. Yes, we are through with what we planned for this month, but I will still use the last week to keep learning and I already have some potential projects, but no specific plans.

I have some old jeans and shirts from my dad I could upcycle. Thanks to my loyal Instagram followers I already have some inspiration on what to do with those, so keep those coming!

The last go on the top is still on the table as well.
Don’t ever get me started on Bernina. Yes, I’ve been a bad friend to her, I still haven't done the maintenance and probably won't be doing it till the end of the month either. At the moment she is running great though.

If I feel inspired I’ll give the embraiding another try and I was thinking about adding some colorful patches to some boring tops and pants. But first, I have to figure out how to make that look cool.

For Christmas, my brother will come here with his two cats, and as they all move into the room where I sleep and where all my sewing stuff is, I have to move the sewing stuff out, because cats and needles don’t mix very well…
Anyway, I wish all of you the most amazing Christmas, even if it is just a small intimate gathering this year. Happy holidays and till next week for the final post about Project Sewing.

Love, <br>
