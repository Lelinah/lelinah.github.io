Since last week’s post, some things have happened. I moved forward with the plants set at the beginning of the month, but I also added some spontaneous projects in between. There are always new impressions that inspire me to try something out. Even though I’ve been doing some extra stuff, we are still totally on track. Actually, we are even getting things done faster than I thought. 

Last week I already made some biker shorts out of old leggings I had lying around. So this week I did a deep dive into my closet and picked out all the clothes I thought I could pimp up a little and I could bear to lose if something went wrong. I also collected everything that had to be repaired or didn’t fit properly. In the next two weeks, I will work on those clothes one after the other. <br>
My first victim was a black mini dress, made from a shiny-velvet fabric with a leopard print from H&M. I cut it in half to make a two-piece out of it, but I am not really happier with it than before. I am still trying to figure out what’s missing to give it that special something. For now, it's back on the pile of old clothes to be transformed.
##### The Patchwork Inverse Seams Shirt
Another spontaneous project of mine went way better! <br>
As I told you last week, I am always looking for information on social media. While I was looking for some sewing blogs, I found this one girl, that is making patchwork shirts out of old shirts from the thrift shop. The seams are turned inside out, it looks kind of messy, but cool at the same time. Over the next days, I saw more and more of those on Instagram, and they have become so popular that people are selling them for like 50 to 100 $. <br>
Sometimes the fabric around the seams has a wavy look to it. I was wondering how to achieve that, so I went on YouTube and started looking for a tutorial. I watched several videos of “hobby-seamstresses” making these so fast, that I had to try it myself. <br>
So I grabbed some of my mom’s good fabric – sorry mom – and started making one. <br>
The first thing you need is a top you already own to guide you for measurements. <br>
Then you just cut pieces of fabric out and arrange them on the base top as you like. Leave extra space for seam allowance. Normally you would lay the faces of two fabrics together, so the seam won't be seen when you flip it over. For this shirt, you do the exact opposite. <br>
The second thing is to use a pretty tight but bis zigzag stitch, so the seam is really noticeable. I think the original design is made with an overlock stitch, but as I don’t have an overlock machine, I made the “cheap” version. <br>
Another thing you have to pay attention to while sewing if you want that wavey seams effect, is to pull the fabric on both sides of the needle. The fabric will shrink back together afterward leaving you with the desired look. Following this technique, you will have to use an elastic fabric. <br>
As I was cutting the patches I got worried, that it will be too big, as I was sewing the patches I got worried it will be too small. In the end, the top fit so perfectly (at least the front part), I was delighted! The upper part of the back was a little too big, so I added a dart. It doesn’t look perfect, but it looks way more perfect than I expected, so I really don’t care! <br>
By adding the stitching at some of the edges without a joining, I finished the top in less than an hour. <br>
With practice, you can make so many of these in such a short time, selling each around 80 $… I see how this is a business!

I love the color blocking with the Lego theme and I felt like Tinkerbell wearing it!
##### Perfect Timing!
NOT! On Wednesday, I wanted to go back to the huge fabric store in Aschaffenburg, but since Aschaffenburg is in Bavaria, it closed on that very day, as Bavaria tightened their corona rules because of rising numbers in the state. <br>
After that setback, I decided to visit a friend of mine in Karlsruhe and go to the sewing job with him. They have a nice big one with a lot of fabrics and all other sewing supplies. I got some yellow jersey for the top that is planned and a thicker winter fabric with a herringbone pattern for the skirt. 
![](/img/sewing/Stoffe_top_rock.jpg)
The jersey is a little thinner than I wanted it to be, but that’s all they had. When we were talking to the shop assistant, she told us, that they weren’t getting any new fabrics in, because of the current situation, so the selection was not as big. <br>
In addition to the fabrics I needed, I got a yellow one in the same color as the jersey that I just had to have to make more scrunchies, because it’s the same color as a scrunchie I recently lost. I already used all of it up and made three scrunchies out of it, Yeay! I actually noticed that if you are using a more rigid fabric the elastic you are using should also be a stronger one. <br>
![](/img/sewing/scrunchies_gelb.jpg)
Besides the fabric, I needed some interfacing, a button, and a sipper (invisible) for the skirt.

I was still waiting for my transparent paper to arrive, so I could start copying the sewing pattern for the skirt and make the one for the top. Lucky me, I got a mail from amazon the next day that the package would NOT be arriving in time and as I didn’t want to wait another four days, I went into town and bought some. I also got threads that matched the fabrics I bought and some embroidering thread, with which I will try to decorate the scrunchies.
##### How To Make Sewing Patterns For Beginners
Making your own sewing patterns is not that simple. I saw some videos of people changing sewing patterns and creating new ones. There were so many angular relationships involved that I think that’s a science for itself. <br>
Nevertheless, there are also easier ways to make a sewing pattern. First one, just buy it. Second one, copy it from other clothes. <br>

First things first, I transferred the sewing pattern for the skirt from the template onto the new paper in the needed size. To do this, you need to find out your size in advance. On the sewing pattern itself is a size chart printed for that. <br>
![](/img/sewing/size_chart.jpg)
If you are not exactly 168 cm tall, you will have to make adjustments for the height. I guess 168 cm is the average height of a woman in Germany or Europe, I don’t know. In each section of the pattern is a line marked, where you are supposed to take length away or add it. In this pattern, there are two of these lines. As I am 171 cm tall, I added 1,5 cm at each one. <br>
The first one was super simple because the line was pretty straight. The second one was located at the curve for the hip and I wasn’t sure at what angle I was supposed to add the 1,5 cm. I just did it straight up and we will see how it works out when the skirt is finished. <br>
Next up was the cutting out part. I always thought that to be the easy part, but sadly I had awful scissors, and the lighting was very bad so that it need way more concentration than I anticipated.

Secondly, I made the sewing pattern for the shirt. Last month I bought a body from Zara with a back cutout, that I used as a template. It has a turtle neck, which I did not want to include in the pattern as well as the lower part of the body.

I folded it in the middle axis and traced around it, first for the front, then for the back. The back cutout I included as well and added the nonexisting neckline freehand. At the open bottom, I drew a straight horizontal line.

##### How To Prepare Your Fabrics For Cutting
Before you can move on to transfer the pattern onto the fabric and cut it, you should wash it first. This is not necessarily a rule, but a pearl of wisdom my grandma passed on to my mom. After washing a fabric for the first time it can slightly change its characteristics and fall differently. So by washing it in advance you will avoid any complications in the future. <br>
I secured the edges of the fabric before washing them, with a zigzag stitch. Otherwise, there is a chance the fabric will unravel in the washing machine. At this opportunity, I used up most of the access thread that was building up on the bobbin wheel. Looked kind of cute, changing from black to blue, to red. <br>

The stretchy jersey was kind of hard to sew. Bernina had some problems maintaining the zigzag pattern, so in the end, there were some random spots in which the stitching was straight instead of zigzag. <br>
![](/img/sewing/ZigZag_fail.jpg)
I didn’t think too much about it, because it would still serve its immediate purpose. I washed the fabrics separately at 30 degrees for 15 min and let them air drying afterward. 

###### Transferring The Sewing Pattern Onto The Fabric And Cutting It
For a good outcome, we always want to start off with a nice wrinkle-free fabric. So don’t forget to iron your fabric before doing anything else, if needed.<br>
I put the yellow jersey on the floor (double-layered) and positioned the front part of the pattern on top. I **DID** remember to leave enough space around it for adding a seam allowance, but I **DID NOT** remember to actually position the pattern at the folded edge of the fabric. By making the pattern only for half the front/back, that would be necessary. So I had to trace the whole thing again.<br>
![](/img/sewing/pattern_on_fabric.jpg)
I also noticed later, that I could have secured the pattern on the fabric with some pins, instead I tried to secure it with just random stuff lying around me, like scissors and pens. It didn’t work so well. 
After finally tracing the edges of the pattern with my awesome new [chalk pen](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0080NO0A0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) from amazon on the right spots of the fabric, my mum checked my work and it was then, I got the tip to secure the two layers of fabric with a pin. <br>
I got the good to go and cut the front piece and the back piece with a 1 cm seam allowance on the edges I later wanted to sew together. The other edges I wanted to leave raw, even though I am not sure if the fabric will unravel if it is not secured properly. We will see with time. 
##### The Final Fit Of My First Self-Tailored Top
The all in all fit was pretty damn good. I only wanna change two things for the second go on this top. On one hand, do I need to cut out the neckline further, and on the other do I need to make the cutout in the back smaller. <br>
Even though I made the cutout the same size as the one from Zara, it came out broader. When taking a pattern from an already existing piece of clothing you always have to keep in mind that if you use a different fabric it will alter the outcome and if you make adjustments on one end of the pattern it can always affect the whole piece. <br>
For example in the case of this shirt, the fabric I used is way thinner than the one the original used, giving the side areas of the back less stability. In addition to that did I cut off the bottom half of the body, meaning there is tension missing to pull the fabric straight around the cutout. The result is a reappearing crease in the side parts of the back at the lower end of the cutout. <br>
![](/img/sewing/first_top_fit.jpg)
For the second try, I will make the cutout smaller so there will be more fabric left, giving the side parts a better structure. Another thing I wanna try is to lay the fabric double so the appearance will be thicker like I was planning from the start. <br>
I expected this shirt not to be perfect on the first try, so I bought enough fabric in advance for 2 or 3 more. 

##### What’s Next?

I don’t know if any of u notices, but I still haven’t done the maintenance on Bernina. I am hoping to get it done this week. <br>
In the pile of clothes, I took out of my closet, there is one dress I want to make tighter around the waist and some other things with holes to plug. <br>
While I will keep working on the top to make the best one possible, will I also get started on the skirt and hopefully finish it this week.<br>
The last thing I wanna do is try myself on embroidering. <br>

That’s it for this week and you will hear from me again next Tuesday!

Love, <br>
