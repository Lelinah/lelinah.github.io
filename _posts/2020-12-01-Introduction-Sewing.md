My grandmother was a designer and modeled her own pieces. In most pictures I’ve seen of her, she's styled up and posing in pretty dresses. I added some of these below, so you can see what I mean.

I bet if she had been alive when I was a child, I would be making my own closes for years now. Sadly, I’ve never met her, because she died before I was born. My mother still has some clothes my grandma made. I wore one of her blouses to my graduation ceremony. It’s loose, cropped and made from a very light black fabric. It also has a bow on the bottom and you close the back with a long row of buttons. I’ve worn the blouse on several occasions now and I find it simply elegant and pretty. I only let my mom wash it though, because I was afraid to destroy it… well, now SHE did. Last time it went in the laundry my mom put it in the drying machine; this could also be my fault, seeing as I didn’t tell her it was in the laundry. Anyway, now it’s all wrinkled and I don’t know if we will be able to safe it…
As a child I was really craftyand creative, my mom loves to do arts and crafs and DIYing so we had a pretty big room in the basement dedicated to it. It was filled with colorful papers, canvases, paints, pearls, yarns and all the stuff you can wish for. Still, I never really learned to sew. I think there was a point in time my mother wanted to teach me, but I quit after the first two lessons. My mom knows how to sew, but for some reason she also taught herself and rather likes to quilt. I think her fashionista gene isn't as evolved as my grandmas or mine. She has a lot pretty shoes though and she knits clothes. But that’s not really my style, at all. The bottom line is, my mom can sew and will help me to learn all the basics.

## Why I should learn sewing and why you should learn sewing as well!
I collected some reasons for myself as to why I would like to lean sewing and why I think it’s a useful skill to have.
##### 1.	Save money by doing your own repairs and adjustments
I think everybody has those clothes, where some seams have started to fall apart or that have gotten ripped. In the past, if something like that happened, I had to store those cloths somewhere in my closet until I visited my parents the next time so that my mom could fix them. If you don’t have a mom who can sew, you'd even have to bring your more valuable pieces to a professional for repair and throw the cheaper ones away. 
For my senior prom, in Germany it’s called the “Abiball”, I had a beautiful two-piece dress from Sherry Hill, but it was too long. Instead of bringing it to the tailor, my mom made the adjustments and we didn’t have to spend the extra money. I do admit, if you make repairs and adjustments yourself, it might not always look absolutely perfect, but most people wont’t even notice the difference and practice makes perfect. You can even start buying all the pretty clothes that would look stunning on you if they would fit better. If you can sew, you can just make those adjustments at home.
##### 2.	Make your own clothes
Every once in a while, I see clothes on Instagram or on people that I just have to have, but I can’t find them anywhere in the quality I want for an affordable price. Often, they are pretty simple pieces, you could probably make yourself. With some time and practice, you can even make more advanced items like fancy dresses and blazers. When you make your own cloths, you can control **MATERIAL**, **QUALITY**, **STYLE**, **SUSTAINABILITY** and you know where it’s from and in what circumstances it was produced. You can learn a lot about a person based on their clothes. Clothes are a way to express yourself, and even though a lot of people do that perfectly well with purchased clothes, with handmade clothes, you can express yourself and your individuality even better.
##### 3.	Nourish your Creativity and Confidence
Having a crafting hobby, challenges your creative side. Completing a project like making a new dress gives you a feeling of pride. Building something from zero to 100%, that’s completely modeled from your own imagination, can be really satisfying. On top of enjoying that achievement for yourself, you can even go outside and show off what you just created. I imagine wearing the things that make you most comfortable will reflect in your confidence and the perception of how others view you.

For me there is an additional motivation to learn sewing. Next year I want to start my master in textile engineering. Even though the master is focused on the technical aspect of the materials themselves, I think it’s an advantage, to know the most common fabrics, their basic structure and how to work them.

So my goal for this month is to understand important background about fabrics, learn all the useful repairing skills for the future and to make an a little more advanced piece of clothing. I am choosing a midi skirt. I wanna make that, because I just watched four seasons of "Velvet", a Spanish drama about a group of seamstresses making their way in the world of fashion in the late 1950s. Some of the characters wear these midi skirts and I find them look really sexy and elegant. Maybe "Velvet" is also one of the reason why I am so inspired to learn sewing now.

## The plan for the next 4 weeks looks as follows:
First, I’m going to collect all the information about different materials, sewing techniques, different machines and other stuff there is to know. At least the basics.

Then I will start with the basics of sewing, like making a straight line and get familiar with the sewing machine. I will learn how to do the little repairs and how to make adjustments for a better fit. 

For my first piece of clothing I wanna make a simple crop top, which I have been looking for for quite a while now.

At the end of the month I want to make the midi skirt as a second piece and as a more advanced challenge. 

Because this is going to be the first project, I have to figure out how much is actually possible to learn in one month. I have this plan, because I want to lean as much as I can, but we'll just see how far I come.
For the blog updates: I am also still new to that, so I have to figure out how often I will post and in what structure the posts will be. Either I will sort them after specific aspects of the projects or I will just make posts about my learning progess with all the aspects mixed together. While I am working on the project, you can follow along real time, by following my Instagram: <https://www.instagram.com/lelinahsblog>.
With that said, I am exited to start the first project and hope some of you will follow along!

Love,
